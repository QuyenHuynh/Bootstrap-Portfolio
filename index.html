                Quyen Huynh is presently an undergraduate student at Georgia State University pursuing a Bachelor's
                degree in Computer Science.
                She is expected to graduate in the spring semester of 2020.
                In addition, she is also currently enrolled part-time in GA Tech's Coding Boot Camp for full stack web
                development.
                She is proficient in Java, HTML, and CSS with an exellent understanding of software security concepts.

            <p>
                Quyen's household consists only of her mother and three dogs, Popo, Shushu, and Booboo. With such a
                small household and so many pets, she is a great help to her mother around the house and is accustomed
                to manual labor.
                Up until last year, she has worked in the restaurant industry in combination with attending school.
                Her weakest attribute is her forgetfulness. However, her forgetfulness has led to her strong
                organizational skills of which she has been forced develop over the years.
            </p>
            <p>
                She has an interest in a vast variety of hobbies which include gaming, gardening, cooking, fishing,
                white water rafting, hiking, photography, and fashion.
                She was formerly a cosmetology student in South Carolina with over 200 credit hours. She moved back to
                Georgia to take advantage of HOPE scholarship and attend college.
                With the new knowledge she has gained through attending GA Tech's Coding Boot Camp, she is currently in
                the process of updating and expanding to an old project, a cosmetics website with numerous pages
                implemented.
